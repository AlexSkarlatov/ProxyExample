Overview
	• The chain of responsibility pattern avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than on e object a chance to handle the request
		○ The chain r


		○ Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object hadnles it
	• This pattern processes a series of objects one by one in  a sequential manner
		○ A source will initiat e this processing
	• Lets you send requests to an object implicitly through a chain of candidate objets
	• After ones processing is done if anything is still pending tican be forwared to next object in the chain
		○ Each receiver contains a reference to another receiver
	• We can add new objects anytime (run timer) at the theend of a chain

Examples
	• In an organization, there are some customer care executives who handle feedback/issues from customers
		○ They will forward these customer issues /aescaltions to the appropriate department in the organization
		○ Not all departments will start fixing the issue
		○ The department that seems to be responsible will take a look first and if the dept staff believe that the issue should be forwarded to another department he she will do that
	• Several class libraries use the chain of responsibility pattern to handle user events
		○ When the suer clicks the mouse or presses a key, an events get generated and passed along the chain
		○ Consdier
	• Consider a congtext sensitive help facility for a cgraph8czl user interface
		○ User can opbtain hep infrmation on any part of the interface just by clicking on it
		○ The help button is provided depends on the part of the interface that is selected and its context
				□  button widge in a dialog box might have different help informtion sthat a similar button the  a main window or another window





			*(
	• Nautral to organize help informaiton according to its generality
		○ From most specific to the most general or a like a chain
JDK EXAMPLE

	• An example in the jsk would be the use of the try catch blocks
		○ Every catch block is kindo of a processor to process that particular e
		○ When any exception occurs in the try block
			§ Sends to the first cathc to process
			§ If the catch block is not able to proc3ss it it forwards the request to next object in chain ( next catch block)
	• Other packages/methods that use this pattern in the jdk include
		○ Java.util.logging.logger
		○ Jafax.servlet.filter#dofilter()


So when to use the patern chain of responsibility
	• When you want to decouple a requesters sender and receiver when multiple objects deteremined at run time are candidates to handle a request
	• When you do not want to specify handlers explicitly in your code
	• When you want to issue ar reqquest to on of several objects without specifyint the receiver explicitly
		○ We expect any of our receivers to handle that request
		○ When multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesn’t have to be a specific object


What are the advantages and drawbacks

	• Decouples the sender of the request and its receivers
		○ Frees an ojbect from knowing which other object handles a request
		○ Both the receiver and the sender have no explicit knowledge of each other
		○ Simplifies your object
			§ It d
	• Simplifies your object
	• It does not have to know the chains structure or keep direct references to it members
		○ Keeps a single referende to their successor
	• Gives you added flexibility in distributing responsibilityies among objects

	• Allows
		○ Allows you to add or remove responsibilities dynamically by changint he memberss or order of the chain
	• A drawback is that the execution of the request is not guaranteed
		○ May fall of the end of the chain if not object handles it
	• Another drawback is that it can be hard to observe and debug at runtime


SUMMARY
	• With the chain of responsibility pattern , you create a chain of oobjects to examine requests
	• Each object in turn examinss a request and either handles it or passes it on to the next object in the chain
Each object in the chain acts as a handler and has a successor object



Participants
	• Handler
		○ Defines an interface for handling requests
		○ Optional impelments the successor link
		○ Must be abstract then?
	• Concrete handler
		○ Handles requests it is responsible for
		○ Can access its successor
		○ If the concrete handler can handle the request, it does so, otherwise it forwards the request to its successor
		○ C
	• Client
		○ Initieates the request to a concrete handler object on the chain
	• When a client issues a r request the r
	• When a client issues a request, the request probagates, along the chain unti a concrete handler object takes repsonsibility for handling it



Important impelmentation considerations
	• Client does not know which part of the chain will be processing the request
		○ It will send the request to the firs object in the chain
	• Each object in the chain will have its own implememantation to process the request
		○ Either full or partial or to send it to the next object in the chain
	• Every object in the chain should have a reference to the next objec t in chain to forward the request to this is achieved by composition
	• Creating the chain carefully is very important
		○ There might be a case thath the request will never be forwarded to a particular processor or there are no objects in the  chain who are able to handle the request
			§ Add a check to make sure it gets processed fully by all the processors
			§ Or hrow an exception if the request reqaches the last object and there are not fourther objects in the chain to forward the request to
